Create an algorithm that receives the value of an angle and uses a switch-case
to display information based on the following options:

1. Sine of the given angle in radians
2. Sine of the given angle in degrees
3. Tangent of the given angle in radians
4. Tangent of the given angle in degrees

To calculate the sine and tangent, use functions available in mathematical libraries
