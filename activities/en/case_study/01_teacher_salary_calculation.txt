Create an algorithm to calculate and display the gross salary and net salary of a teacher.

The program should request the following information from the user:
1. Hourly rate;
2. Number of classes taught in the month;
3. INSS discount percentage.

Based on this data, the program should perform the following calculations:
- Gross salary: obtained by multiplying the number of classes by the hourly rate;
- Net salary: calculated by subtracting the INSS discount from the gross salary.

Finally, display the values of the gross salary and net salary on the screen.
