Develop and implement an application in C++ that uses the switch-case
for options given by a range of values.

Activity:

Create an algorithm that receives a person's weight and height and,
based on this, calculates their BMI and displays the results.

Consider:

BMI formula = weight / (height * height)
Classification:
1. Below 19.0: Underweight
2. Between 19.0 and 24.9: Normal weight
3. Between 25.0 and 29.9: Overweight
4. 30.0 or more: Obesity

Use the switch-case to determine the classification based on the range of values.
